# MovingDay
Unity App 1 - 
This was written while I was in the middle of a move, thus surround by boxes...

### Instructions:
Watch while the boxes surround you.  You can walk with arrow keys, but you can't escape the boxes.
Pressing escape key will grant you a temporary reprieve, but the boxes will return. 
There is no where to go.

Unless you press Alt+F4
